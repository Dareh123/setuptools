Develop command no longer uses easy_install, but instead defers execution to pip (which then will re-invoke Setuptools via PEP 517 to build the editable wheel). Most of the options to develop are dropped. This is the final warning before the command is dropped completely in a few months. Use-cases relying on 'setup.py develop' should pin to older Setuptools version or migrate to modern build tooling.
