Added initial implementation of :pep:`639`.
Users relying on pre-:pep:`639` implementation details
(like precise license file paths inside ``dist-info`` directory)
may need to adjust their code base to avoid problems.
Deprecations and stronger validation were also introduced
(see details in the **Features** section).
